# Services Offered

We are able to assist with a wide range of data analysis problems, such as:

* Patterns of gene expression among individuals, tissues, etc.
* Whether and how gene expression changes in response to experimental stimulus
* Quantifying the relationships between genetic and phenotypic variation
* Biomarker discovery
* Estimation and comparison of rates of sequence evolution

These questions may be addressed with one or more of the following methods:

* Processing and preliminary analysis of data from Illumina, Pacific Biosciences, and Oxford Nanopore sequencing data
* Quantification of counts of gene expression from bulk or single cell RNA sequencing, and subsequent analysis of differential gene expression
* Discovery of single nucleotide variants, small insertion/deletions, and larger structural variation from whole genome, whole exome, or other target capture sequencing
* Assembly and annotation of gene and genome sequence data
* Multiple sequence or genome alignment
* Imputation of genotypes from variant data

We can provide detailed, reproducible analysis tools, intermediate and final analysis output, and publication-quality figures and tables.

Note: we provide data analysis services. If you need to generate sequence data, please contact the [Genome Sequencing Core](https://gsc.ku.edu){:target="\_blank"}
