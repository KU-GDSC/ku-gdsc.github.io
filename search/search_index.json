Additionally, products that result from substantial contributions of our staff to experimental design, implementation, analysis and interpretation of resulting data, and/or drafting and revision of manuscripts, should include the relevant contributors as co-authors. Whether a project will entail co-authorship is an important conversation we will have at the outset of new collaborations, pending an assessment of the efforts that will be required. Grant Applications We strongly encourage researchers to contact us at the earliest possible stage in the development of projects. Through these conversations we can help discuss issues related to experimental design and data collection that may impact downstream analysis. These discussions will also help to clarify our estimates of the extent of our contributions to a project, which can result in letters of support or assignment of our staff as funded, grant personnel as necessary.","title":"Policies"},{"location":"policies/#policies","text":"","title":"Policies"},{"location":"policies/#acknowledgement-and-authorship","text":"Publications, presentations, grants, and other related products resulting from contributions from our service should acknowledge K-INBRE, which is supported by the IDeA Program of the National Institute of General Medical Science award number P20 GM103418, as well as the University of Kansas Center for Genomics.
